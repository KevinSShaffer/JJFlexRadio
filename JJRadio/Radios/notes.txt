Memory groups:
    ReservedGroups is on a per rig basis.

TNFBug:
TNFTemp:
    double Frequency
    double Bandwidth
    boll Permanent
    uint Depth
    bool Readonly
in FlexTNF:
    addbutton:
        Permanent=true is default
    removeButton:
        not active if Readonly
    depth, permanent and width properties:
        Use info from TNFTemp
        Frequency also
FlexTNFFixup:
    Config:
        Read in TNFTemp data
        If TNFs nonempty, return
        Ignore and discard if Permanent not set
        Add TNFs from TNFTemp data if first one has id == 0,
        otherwise mark as Readonly
Upon disconnect, TNFs = new list

Flex memories:
Allow for vfo = rigcaps.vfos.none.
Create Memories array when memories changed and at init time.
MemoryToVFO just turns off MemoryMode

try on ic9100:
    transmit:1A  05 0013 00, 01 Send/read PTT Lock function OFF Send/read PTT Lock function ON  

IC9100 main/sub:
    left-most (o)ff or o(n) x will exchange
        always active
    right-most ' ', 'm', or 's': blank if off, m if controling main, s for sub.
        when made active, control is on main.
        When made inactive, control goes back to main automatically.

enhancements:
clear eq settings on the Flex.

Icom memories:
    2 memory groups, hf and vhf
    CurrentMemoryNumber is channel + 1
    MemoryType class used by contMemContents as intermediate to set up memdata.
    getMemories:
        get hf and vhf memories.
        set Memories to current bank.

Panning:
    setup:
        Provide freq change routine.
    FreqChange():
        if freq in segment, return.
        segment = Bands.Query(freq)
        bandsMode = conversion from flex modes.
        Use segment.Divisions to get segment.High, lowest freq higher than freq.
        start panning.

sub rx on/off:
RigDependent class:
    Active property:
        provide routines to get and set
ts2000:
subrcvr region:
    active property:
        set with SB command.
form1:
adjustRigField:
    if space entered, 
        toggle Active.
        return fld.value
