    <h2><a id="GettingStarted">Getting Started</a></h2>
    <p>When JJRadio starts up for the first time, you will be asked to enter some information about yourself, the path to your log file, and your rigs.
    The first screen asks for your full name, handle, QTH, and log file.</p>
    <p>For your QTH, something like "City, ST" is recommended, e.g. "Austin, TX", without the quotes.</p>
    <p>The next field asks for the log file name.  You can click the following "Browse" button to bring up the file open dialogue.  You'll likely be in your Documents folder.  If you enter a new file name, and you should the first time, it'll be created.  The default extention is .jrl (JJ Radio Logfile).
    The log file format used is not compatible with any other file format, although the log can be exported to the ADIF format, or initialized by importing an existing ADIF file.</p>
    <p>Leave the "Default Operator button checked, and press the Add button.
    You will be taken to the Rig Information dialogue.</p>
    <p>At this point you may click the Cancel button or hit escape if you don't want to setup a rig.
    Otherwise you are asked for the Rig Name, Model, Com port, baud rate, parity, data bits, stop bits, handshake, and whether you want this to be the default rig.</p>
    <p>The Rig Name is just a name used to reference the radio.
    The Model is selected from a list box.</p>
    <p>You next select a com port from a list of ports available on your system.  Thus the Com port you intend to use should already be set up.  If not, you can cancel out of here and come back to this setup dialogue later from the Actions menu.</p>
    <p>The next fields are serial parameters used to control/monitor the rig.</p>
    <p>You'll likely want the first rig you enter to be the default rig, but that's not required.
    You may now click the "Add Another" button or the "Last one" Button.
    In any case, you should have defined a default rig when finished.</p>
    <p>You're now ready to start enjoying JJRadio.</p>
    <h3><a id="DidntOpen">Port COMx didn't open</a></h3>
    <p>If the serial port isn't connected, you'll get an error telling you that the port didn't open.
    You may Try Again or Cancel this message.
    If you cancel it, JJRadio checks periodically to see if the port has become available, and if so, you'll see the meter and frequency displayed.
    If you click OK, JJRadio immediately tries to connect.</p>
    <h2><a id="Main">The main window</a></h2>
    <p>The main window is composed of 4 fields.
    The first is the meter and frequency display.
    The next field is for received text.  This is currently only used to display direct command output discussed later.
    The Sent Text field isn't used at present.
    The last field is a status field.  Upon startup, JJRadio reads the memories from your radio, and this will display the progress.</p>
    <p>Note:  In general, you won't want to use menu shortcut keys such as alt-A for the Actions menu and alt-H for the help menu.
    JJRadio uses alt key combinations for logging, and these can conflict with those popular key strokes.
    Pressing the Alt key will get you to the menu bar though.
    The F1 key brings up a list of valid keyboard command keys.</p>
    <h2><a id="FreqDisp">The Meter and Frequency Display</a></h2>
    <p>At present, JJRadio works with the Kenwood TS930 PIEXX board, therefore the functions of the program are limited to displaying the meter and frequency.
    It can however read and write the radio's memories, at least the frequency.</p>
    <p>The display is in the form "meter frequency".
    The meter value is the raw value read from the rig.  Thus it may be used to find a peak value during transmit, for example.
    The frequency is broken up into 3 parts.</p>
    <p>The first part isn't displayed unless separate VFOs are being used.  If so, this shows an "S".</p>
    <p>The second part is either "A" or "B", depending upon which VFO is currently selected.</p>
    <p>Finally, the frequency is shown in the form mm.kkk.hhh, MHZ, KHZ, HZ.</p>
    <p>Thus you might see a value like:</p>
    <xmp>0005 A14.201.540</xmp>
    <p>if you're using VFO A set to 14.201540 MHZ, and transceiving with VFO A.
    This display is short and sweet and works great with a braille display.  Turn the dial and watch the frequency change.</p>
    <p>NOTE:  If you're using JAWS 14, you may need to uncheck "Enhanced Edit Support" to get the continuous frequency display to work.
    Versions prior to 14 don't have this problem.
    To uncheck this, use JAWSKEY-F2 and select "Settings Center".
    Search for the word "Enhanced", and uncheck "Enhanced Edit Mode".</p>
    <h2><a id="Logging">Logging</a></h2>
    <p>JJRadio allows you to do your logging with the same program you use to monitor your rig.
    It is good to become familiar with the keystrokes used to log information, and the behavior of the log window in general, before attempting to use it.
    Once you're familiar with the logging, you can just turn off the speech from your screen reader and use the braille display.</p>
    <h3><a id="LogWindow">Some general Information About the Log Window</a></h3>
    <p>The log window can be brought up with key sequences, and brought down immediately with either the Enter or Escape key.
    If you exit the window with the escape key, any new information you entered is discarded.
    If you use the Enter key, the new information is remembered, but not logged yet.
    The exception to this is the Comments field, where the Enter key adds a new line.
    It is important to note that an entry isn't logged until you use the "Write Log Entry" key, set by default to ctrl-W.
    </p>
    <p>For example, if you've just come to the log form to enter the QTH, and you know it's wrong and want to start over, you can hit Escape, and come back to it when the station is repeating it.
    However, if you've entered other information and use Escape, that will need to be re-entered too, so be careful here.
    Remember, unless in the Comments field, pressing enter leaves the form, remembers the information, but doesn't log it.
    If you're in the Comments field, hit Tab to leave the field and then press Enter.</p>
    <p>Field formats aren't checked, so you can enter anything into any field, except for Tab and Enter.
    Enter behaves as described, and Tab takes you to the next field.
    You can also enter the key sequences to go to other log fields.  For example, you can jump from the Callsign field to the Comment field if you wish.</p>
    <h3><a id="LogJump">Going to Log Fields</a></h3>
    <p>You use a key sequence to go to a log field.
    If you're at the main window, the log window is brought up and you're positioned in the desired field.
    If you're already in the log window, you simply jump to the desired field.</p>
    <p>Let's go through a typical QSO, showing the default keys used to log information.  You can change these key sequences if you wish.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>When you contact a station you'll want to start a new log entry, probably with ctrl-N, new log entry.
    This will position you in the Callsign field.  It also logs the date and time, default mode, and the TX and RX frequencies.
    You'll likely want to enter the call at this point, so let's assume you do.</li>
    <li>Now let's say you're going to enter your info such as signal report, QTH and name.
    As part of this, you might want to log the Op's signal report in the HisRST field which immediately follows the Callsign field.  You can get to this field with the tab key if you're still in the log form, or no matter whether you are or not, by using alt-H.
    After you've done that, you'll want to log the other guy's info as he transmits it.</li>
    <li>You're still in the log form, although you might have left it using the Enter key after entering the call.
    In either case, you now want to log your signal report with alt-M.
    If you're still in the form, the field after HisRST is MyRST, so tab would work too.</li>
    <li>And so it goes.  The next field is QTH, alt-Q; followed by State/Province, alt-S; followed by Handle, alt-N (N for name).</li>
    <li>The following fields are Rig, alt-R; Antenna, alt-A; and Comments, alt-E.
    Note that alt-C is for the Callsign.
    Also, alt-O takes you to the mode.</li>
    <li>The alt-D sequence is used for date/time, and behaves a bit differently from the other key sequences.
    If you're at the main window and use alt-D, the date/time in the log is set to the current values.  Note that I just use your local time at present.
    If you're in the log form, alt-D just takes you to the date field so you can change it or the time which immediately follows the date.</li>
    <li>That's it for the fields with key sequences.
    There are some informational fields with country information that follow the Comments field.
    These are the country, ITU and CQ zones, and the time offset from GMT of that country's capital.
    Note that a country may have multiple zones.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a id="Menu">The Menus</a></h2>
    <p>Currently there are two menus, the Actions and Help menus.
    As previously mentioned, don't use shortcut keys to access these menus, as these are likely used for other actions such as logging.</p>
    <h3><a id="Actions">The Actions menu</a></h3>
    <p>The Actions menu currently consists of the following items:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>List Operators</li>
    <p>You have the capability of having multiple operators.
    JJRadio uses the default operator when first brought up.
    You can use this dialogue to change the current operator.
    Currently the only real effect this has is to use a different log file, the one defined for that operator.</p>
    <p>You may also use this dialogue to add another operator by clicking the "New" button.</p>
    <p>You may update an operator's information by checking that operator and clicking the "Update" button.
    Similarly you may delete an operator.</p>
    <p>When done, click "Finished or hit escape.</p>
    <li>List Rigs</li>
    <p>This allows you to show and perhaps change the current rig.
    As with the Operators dialogue, you can also add another rig here.</p>
    <li>Logfile Open</li>
    <p>This is used if you want to change just the log file for the current operator.
    In reality, the log file is opened/created when logging for the first entry is begun.</p>
    <li>Import Log</li>
    <p>This will import an ADIF file into the current log.
    It is important to note that the log is replaced by the entries in the ADIF file.
    Thus this would normally be used on an empty log.</p>
    <li>Export Log</li>
    <p>This exports the current log to an ADIF file.</p>
    <li>Change Key Mapping</li>
    <p>Change key mapping brings up a dialogue allowing you to change the key mappings.
    When the dialogue comes up, you are in a list of items, each of which has a check box.
    With an item selected, you may press Tab to get to a field where you can press the new key sequence for the associated function.
    If you have now duplicated another definition, both items are checked.</p>
    <p>Thus the check boxes let you know where the duplicate key definitions are so you can correct one or both.
    For example, if I change the key for Call from alt-C to alt-L, I am brought back to the list and now the current item is checked, along with the "alt-L Bring up Log Form" item.
    I should either change one of these, or hit escape to cancel my changes.</p>
    <li>Restore Default Key Mapping</li>
    <p>As the name implies, this restores the original key mapping.</p>
    <li>Enable Screen Saver</li>
    <p>I found that while operating I would get in a QSO and not touch the computer for a period of time.
    It was annoying to have my screen saver come up in the middle of a QSO, because my screen saver starts up work items using the Worldwide Grid.
    When JJRadio is started, if your screen saver is active, it is disabled.
    It is re-enabled on exit.
    You can use this item to enable it while the program is running.</p>
    <li>Exit</li>
    <p>This exits JJRadio.  Alt-F4 also works.
    If you have an incomplete log entry, you are asked if you want to write it.
    Remember, log entries are only written when you use the key sequence for that, ctrl-W by default.</p>
    </ul>
    <h3><a id="Help">The Help menu</a></h3>
    <p>This currently has three items:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Help Page</li>
    <p>This brings up this help page.</p>
    <li>Key Assignments</li>
    <p>This brings up the list of key assignments.  This list may also be shown with the F1 key.</p>
    <li>About</li>
    <p>This shows information about JJRadio.</p>
    </ul>
